# Transcript-Generator
We are making the transcript geneartor for our college.We need to make the SPI CPI output into a PDF for transcript.
For this we are using GUI interface or a web interface.
For processing data we used python as well to handle pdf there is use of Python supported pdf generation library like pypdf..etc.
GUI interface would have option of enter a range of valid roll numbers.Then on single click the program whould generate  all the transcript 
for that range. So if range is 1901ee38-1901ee41, it would generate 4 pdfs. In case the range is invalid
flah pop up message is displayed.
