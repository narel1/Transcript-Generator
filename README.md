# Transcript-Generator
We are making the transcript generator for our college. We need to make the SPI CPI output into a PDF for the transcript.
For this, we are using a GUI interface or a web interface.
For processing data we used python as well to handle pdf there is the use of Python supported pdf generation library like pypdf..etc.
GUI interface would have the option of entering a range of valid roll numbers. Then with a single click, the program would generate all the transcripts. 
for that range. So if the range is 1901ee38-1901ee41, it would generate 4 pdfs. In case the range is invalid
flash pop-up message is displayed using a flask.
